# Overview & Theme
The idea for this map is an 3-layer structure surrounded by water.  The three different layers would be connected by flights of stairs.
The idea is to have the more powerful weapons located on the basement floor where they're the most susceptical to danger.
This map concept was inspired from bomberman 64's Up & Down.
